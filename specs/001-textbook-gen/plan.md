# Implementation Plan: Textbook Generation

**Branch**: `001-textbook-gen` | **Date**: 2025-12-06 | **Spec**: /specs/001-textbook-gen/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/yusraa/AI-Humanaid-Robotic/specs/001-textbook-gen/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Primary requirement: A user wants to generate a comprehensive textbook on a specified topic.
Technical approach: NEEDS RESEARCH

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Qdrant, Neon (PostgreSQL)
**Storage**: Qdrant (vector database), Neon (PostgreSQL)
**Testing**: pytest (NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Web application (Docusaurus frontend, FastAPI backend)
**Performance Goals**: Generate textbook within 5 minutes (average complexity); Handle 10 concurrent requests without significant performance degradation (<20% increase in generation time)
**Constraints**: No heavy GPU usage, Minimal embeddings, <200ms p95 latency (NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
**Scale/Scope**: 10k users (NEEDS CLARIFICATION), Comprehensive textbook generation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Core Principles:**
- Simplicity: All components and solutions must prioritize clarity and ease of understanding. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Accuracy: Information presented in the textbook and generated by the RAG chatbot must be factually correct and reliable.
- Minimalism: Design and implementation should be lean, focusing on essential features to ensure fast builds and efficient resource usage.
- Fast Builds: The Docusaurus site and any associated services must be optimized for rapid build times, minimizing development and deployment friction.
- Free-tier Architecture: All infrastructure and service choices must adhere to free-tier limitations to ensure accessibility and minimize operational costs.
- RAG Answers ONLY from Book Text: The RAG chatbot must exclusively use the content of the textbook as its knowledge base, preventing hallucination and ensuring contextual relevance.

**Constraints:**
- No heavy GPU usage
- Minimal embeddings

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must

**Structure Decision**: Web application with separate `backend` (FastAPI for textbook generation and RAG chatbot) and `frontend` (Docusaurus for textbook presentation and UI).

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
