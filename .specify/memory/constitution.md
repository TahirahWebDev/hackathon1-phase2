# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Essentials Constitution

## Core Principles

### Simplicity
All components and solutions must prioritize clarity and ease of understanding. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

### Accuracy
Information presented in the textbook and generated by the RAG chatbot must be factually correct and reliable.

### Minimalism
Design and implementation should be lean, focusing on essential features to ensure fast builds and efficient resource usage.

### Fast Builds
The Docusaurus site and any associated services must be optimized for rapid build times, minimizing development and deployment friction.

### Free-tier Architecture
All infrastructure and service choices must adhere to free-tier limitations to ensure accessibility and minimize operational costs.

### RAG Answers ONLY from Book Text
The RAG chatbot must exclusively use the content of the textbook as its knowledge base, preventing hallucination and ensuring contextual relevance.

## Key Features

- Docusaurus textbook
- RAG chatbot (Qdrant + Neon + FastAPI)
- Select-text → Ask AI
- Optional Urdu / Personalize features

## Constraints

- No heavy GPU usage
- Minimal embeddings

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan.
All outputs must strictly follow user intent.
Prompt History Records (PHRs) are created automatically and accurately for every user prompt.
Architectural Decision Record (ADR) suggestions are made intelligently for significant decisions, but never auto-created.
All changes are small, testable, and reference code precisely.
Build success must be ensured.
Chatbot answers must be accurate.
UI must be clean.
Smooth GitHub Pages deployment must be achieved.
